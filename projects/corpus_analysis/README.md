# Corpus Analysis Tools

This directory contains tools for analyzing PNG file corpora generated by the fuzzing-for-llms project.

## Files

- `analysis.py` - Basic corpus analysis script with manual corpus selection
- `enhanced_analysis.py` - Comprehensive analysis with detailed statistics, visualizations, and keyword analysis
- `reports/` - Directory containing generated reports and visualizations
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Usage

Both scripts analyze PNG files from the `corpus_output/` directory and generate reports in the local `reports/` directory.

### Basic Analysis
```bash
cd projects/corpus_analysis/
python analysis.py
```

### Enhanced Analysis
```bash
cd projects/corpus_analysis/
python enhanced_analysis.py
```

## Features

### Basic Analysis (`analysis.py`)
- File hash comparison between corpora
- Jaccard similarity calculation
- Basic file size distribution plots
- Manual corpus selection

### Enhanced Analysis (`enhanced_analysis.py`)
- Comprehensive file statistics (min, max, mean, median, percentiles)
- Venn diagrams showing file overlap
- Enhanced file size distribution plots (histogram + box plot)
- Subtool production analysis from log files
- Keyword/query overlap analysis
- Detailed markdown reports with explanations

## Dependencies

The enhanced analysis requires additional packages:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib-venn

Install with:
```bash
conda install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib-venn
```

## Output

Both scripts generate:
- Markdown reports in `reports/`
- Visualization plots (PNG files)
- Console output with key statistics

The enhanced analysis provides much more detailed insights into corpus characteristics and generation patterns.
