I am going to give you a link that contains a github repository that may only take certain file types as valid inputs. Explore the repository with the link, and find out what file types it may take as inputs. You should exactly output the file types and nothing more, as they will be passed in as arguments for other purposes. For example, if the repository takes pdf as input, output "pdf". If there are multiple possible file types, separate them by a single comma without space and output them all, for example, "pdf,docx". You should ignore identical file types but with different names. For example, you should not output "jpg" and "jpeg"; instead, print "jpg" once. If the given repository does not take a certain file type as input or simply is not a program runnable, output "no valid file type" exactly. You should explore within the directory to look for instructions that might reveal information about the input file types. If you are able to do so, you should also look at the source code to extract some information. If the repository is well known, you can also search for information through the internet. I am about to give you the github repository link in the user input.
