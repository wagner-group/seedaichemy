Hi! I'm a security engineer that is looking to improve the quality of my fuzzing harness.

The goal is to look at how the corpus of the fuzzing harness can be improved.

The project is {PROJECT_NAME} and the repository of the project is {PROJECT_REPOSITORY}.

The fuzzer I'm working on is:
<code>
{HARNESS_SOURCE_CODE}
</code>

Could you please generate 5 initial seeds files for my fuzz harness?

The corpus should be structured seeds files that reflect the structure of the target program. It should not be based purely on the output from random.

Wrap the each seed files in <result> tags in the reply and do not return any other text.
