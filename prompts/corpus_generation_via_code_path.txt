Hi! I'm a security engineer that is looking to improve the quality of my fuzzing harness.

The goal is to look at how the corpus of the fuzzing harness can be improved.

The project is {PROJECT_NAME} and the repository of the project is {PROJECT_REPOSITORY}.

I need you to generate {FILETYPE} so it can trigger
<code_path>
{CODE_PATH}
</code_path>

Could you please write a python script that generate 5 initial seeds files which trigger my code path?

Please only include python scripts.

Wrap your python script in <results> tag
